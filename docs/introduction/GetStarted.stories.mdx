Below contains instructions on how to use the design-system in web and native applications (React and React Native)

## Install

`yarn add @design-system/react-core`  Contains components in common between web and native. <br/>
`yarn add @design-system/react-native-kit` Contains web-specific components. <br/>

### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { ThemeProvider, Button, lightTheme } from ‘@design-system/react-core’;`

and use them like so

```jsx

const App = () => (

  <ThemeProvider theme="ligthTheme">

    <Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')}>Button</Button>

  </ThemeProvider>

);

```
